*A Love Letter to Chaotic Creation*

## 🔮 **What the Hell Is This?**  
A **neon-drenched playground** where my insomnia and Groq's Llama3 had a baby. This isn't just another AI chat interface - it's my **artistic copilot** with:  

- **Rihanna-level sass** in every response  
- **Production-ready code snippets** (I test every damn one)  
- **My personal design rules** baked into the AI's DNA  
- That sexy **Vercel + Groq** combo that makes it stupid fast

## 🖤 **Why I Built This**  
*(Because apparently "I was bored" wasn't a good enough answer)*  

1. **Tired of polite AIs** that won't tell you your color palette sucks  
2. **Wanted instant art/code collabs** without 20 Discord messages  
3. **Needed a vessel** for my particular brand of creative chaos

## ⚙️ **Under the Hood**  

### **The Tech Stack I Battled With**  
```javascript
const techStack = {
  frontend: "Pure HTML/CSS/JS (fight me)",  
  backend: "Vercel serverless (lazy mode)",  
  ai: "Groq + Llama3-70b (brutally fast)",  
  styling: "Neon blood splatters (aesthetic)",  
  sanity: "0% remaining"  
}
```

### **Key Features I'm Weirdly Proud Of**  
✅ **Custom markdown parser** that makes code snippets *obscenely* copy-pasteable  
✅ **Paste normalization** so your messy code doesn't break my beautiful UI  
✅ **Mobile-responsive** despite my hatred of small screens  
✅ **That typing indicator** that dots animate exactly how I wanted

## 💀 **Known Issues (Because Nothing's Perfect)**  
- Sometimes tells people their design taste is "basic" (this is a feature)  
- Might judge your life choices if you ask for Comic Sans  
- The dark theme may cause existential dread
