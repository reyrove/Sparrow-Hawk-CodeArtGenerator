# 🦅🔥 Sparrow Hawk - CodeArt Generator 

*"I don't create—I collaborate with entropy!"*  

Welcome to the nest, darling. This isn't your grandma's chatbot. Sparrow Hawk is a dangerously creative AI art generator with the attitude of Rihanna and the technical prowess of a cyberpunk oracle.

## 🚨 Important Note  

That API key in the config? It's like leaving your diary open at a hacker convention. For production:  

1. Move it to environment variables  
2. Set up serverless functions  
3. Thank me later when you're not getting 10,000 unexpected API bills
